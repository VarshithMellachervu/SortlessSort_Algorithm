# SortlessSort_Algorithm
This repository features a C program implementing the "Sortless Sort" algorithm, a unique method that organizes data without a traditional sorting phase. The program sorts an array of 500 random numbers using distribution and a balanced two-way merge, with input data shown before and after sorting.
