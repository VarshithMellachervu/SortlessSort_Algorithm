# SortlessSort_Algorithm
The SortlessSort_Algorithm repository consists of a C program that implements the "Sortless Sort" algorithm, a unique approach to sorting data without utilizing the traditional sorting phase. This innovative technique organizes data by alternatively distributing elements into two separate lists and merging them then in a balanced way. The project focuses on sorting an array of random 500 numbers which are generated and printed first hand. The algorithm works by recursive distribution which splits arrays into two sublists based on element positions and merge these sublists in order to obtain sorted arrays. After that sorting is done, program displays arrays before and after sorting process has been completed. This project places emphasis on an alternative sorting technique and shows how different ways can be employed for efficient data organization.
